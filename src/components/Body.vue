                    <p>The 50 | 30 | 20 rule recommends putting 50% of your money toward needs, 30% toward wants, and 20%
                    toward savings.</p>
            <div>
            <img src="./icons/Chart.png" alt="Chart showing the 50 | 30 | 20 rule." style="width:650px;height:500px;">
        </div>
        <div class="Needs">

            <h2>Needs: 50%</h2>
            <p>
                These are expenses that must be met no matter what, such as:
                <li>Utility bills</li>
                <li>Rent or mortgage payments</li>
                <li>Health care</li>
                <li>Groceries</li>
                If you can honestly say “I can’t live without it,” you have identified a need. Minimum required payments
                on
                a
                credit card or a loan also belong in this category.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="Wants">
            <h2>Wants: 30%</h2>
            <p>
                Wants are things you enjoy that you spend money on by choice, not becuse you need it to live such as:
                <li>Subscriptions</li>
                <li>Supplies for hobbies</li>
                <li>Restaurant meals</li>
                <li>Vacations</li>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Savings">
            <H2>Savings: 20%</H2>
            <p>The remaining 20% of your budget should go to your funding your future.
                You may put money in an emergency fund, contribute to a retirement account, or save toward a down
                payment on
                a home.
                Paying down debt beyond the minimum payment amount belongs in this category, too.</p>
